Brewstr Web-Based Community Application

This application is built for the Brewstr Automated Hombrewing machine. It acts as a web platform to provide 
information on the team, project, and product. I'm in the stages of linking it to our back-end database to provide
the users with a recipe marketplace and sharing hub.

Development Environment:
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
Twitter Bootstrap V3.0.0
